                            Cities are looking at MaaS (Mobility as a Service) to develop sustainable, healthier, less congested transit models. Migo plays a critical role through service discovery, giving people data and the confidence to try something new.

                                Many large cities average 15–20 mobility apps that offer their services within that city, but 80% of residents only have 2–3 of those apps installed. This also leaves out any tourists that may be unfamiliar with all of the avilable options. Migo can expose
                                all of those services in one app without the friction of installing new apps or switching back and forth to compare prices and pickup times.

                                Migo is an effective way to introduce your service to quality new users by letting them discover and learn about you at the exact moment they need a ride. Migo compliments how users think when making mobility decisions. We show clear, at-a-glance information
                                like Health Safety, Pickup Reliability, and environmental impact to help to give users confidence when considering an unfamiliar provider.
