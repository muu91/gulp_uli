                    Your privacy and trust are important to us. This Privacy Statement explains how Thomson Reuters Holdings Inc. and the Thomson Reuters group of companies (we refer to these as “Thomson Reuters”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) collect, use, and share your personal
                    information in connection with the website, application (including a mobile application), product, software, or service that links to this Privacy Statement (we call these our “Services”).
                </p>
                <p>
                    This Privacy Statement, however, does not apply to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Our customers’ “content” that is inputted/uploaded and processed, stored, or hosted by our customers using our Services in connection with their account with us, in which this personal information is governed by our customers’ respective privacy policies;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The “content” that is distributed within our Services (including with respect to personal information included in such content), although this is addressed in our Informational Content Privacy Statement; or
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Any website, application, product, software, service, or content that are offered by third parties or that link to their own privacy statement, privacy policy, or privacy notice.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Importantly, some laws (like GDPR) distinguish between a “controller” and a “processor” (or similar terms). We note that we are a “controller” for those Services where we make decisions on how personal information is used in connection with our Services,
                    and we are a “processor” for those Services where we only use personal information as allowed by our customers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Where we make decisions on how personal information is used in connection with our Services (where we are acting as a controller), we are responsible for the obligations of a “controller” under applicable laws in connection with the processing of personal
                    information – for example, we use this Privacy Statement and other notices to provide you with information about our use of personal information, as required by law. Where we only use personal information as allowed by our customers
                    (where we are acting as a processor), our customers are similarly responsible for the obligations of a “controller” under applicable laws in connection with the processing of personal information, and, if you are using our Services
                    through one of our customers, you should contact them if you have questions or concerns about the processing of your personal information or compliance with applicable laws.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For California Consumers, we have also prepared a Supplemental Privacy Statement for California Consumers under CCPA (“California Statement”) in compliance with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”). Please review our California Statement
                    attached below for more information.
