                                        Dr. Kain’s current role as a licensed clinical psychologist is a function of her cumulative life experiences. Her professional passion resides in working with various manifestations of systemic trauma; high-need, clinically complex populations that exist
                                        at the intersection of legal and mental health issues. Dr. Kain attended the University of Michigan for her undergraduate degree in Psychology, and received her Masters and PsyD in Clinical Psychology through Antioch
                                        University Santa Barbara. Drawing upon her education and training in these arenas, Megan has had stimulating clinical experiences that encompass a wide spectrum of populations: outpatient level of care, in-patient
                                        psychiatric hospitalization, in-home therapy with victims of crime, consulting work to develop and enhance clinical programming at in-patient level of care, working with the Department of Child and Family Services
                                        conducting psychological assessments of child survivors of abuse as well as infants exposed in utero to illicit substances. Dr. Kain has had the distinct honor of working with nonprofits such as the Center for Health
                                        Justice to increase equal access of inmates in the Los Angeles County Jail system to quality mental health services as well as medical services. Most recently, she served as staff psychologist with the California
                                        Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections conducting crisis evaluation, mental health assessments, and individual therapy with men at the reception phase of incarceration. Currently, Dr. Kain serves as Clinical
                                        Director at Trauma and Wellness Center, an outpatient mental health clinic in Los Angeles. Before her career as a Clinical Psychologist, Dr. Kain worked as a contemporary dancer; expression through arts is vital
                                        to her. She blends her life experience with the knowledge from her doctorate to help others experience the power of the mind and body connection. She is a lifelong advocate for progressive causes and passionate
                                        about LGBTQ rights. Dr. Kain considers her role as Clinical Director with Overland an exciting platform to apply the experiential wisdom and tools accrued and to be able to contribute to a treatment team approach
                                        that fully meets the unique needs of our population, and to overall, stoke hope.

                                        emphasizing emotional experience as key to personality functioning, she uses an integrative approach with clients, incorporating Jungian and analytical psychology, cognitive behavior therapy, trauma-informed practices,

                                        in private practice, community mental health, dual diagnosis treatment centers, in-patient psychiatric hospital, and forensic settings. In her work with clients and families, she uses a strengths-based approach,
                                        empowering individuals to focus on their strengths, in order to discover new and more useful patterns of behavior. Dr. D’Angelo has numerous years of experience in management and leadership and is the Executive
                                        Director of Trauma and Wellness Center, a non-profit organization in Los Angeles dedicated to treatment of psychiatric and addictive disorders for the underserved community. She has extensive experience with managing

                                        Her work includes clinical supervision of master’s level therapists and psychological assistants at the post-doctoral level with various specializations. She serves as adjunct faculty in the forensic psychology

                                        Greysi received her Bachelor’s in Psychology from CSU Long Beach and her Master’s in Clinical Psychology from Alliant International University. She pursued a Doctorate in Clinical Psychology which she is near to completing. Greysi has had the opportunity
                                        to train and offer therapeutic services at the Ronald McDonald House, at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles. She has also trained and provided services at Didi Hirsch Mental Health Services, a leading provider of mental
                                        health, substance use, and suicide prevention. In these locations she provided therapy and assessments in English and Spanish, and worked with diverse individuals, couples, and families including veterans, LGBTQA+,
                                        geriatrics, and people with disabilities. Her experience includes treating Anxiety, Depression, PTSD, BPD, Substance Use/Comorbidity, Grief and Loss, Couples Issues, and Parenting Support. Additionally, she facilitates
                                        therapy groups where the goal is to provide psychoeducation, skill development, and processing. Greysi’s theoretical approach is a combination of Family Systems, which helps us understand our past and Cognitive
                                        Behavioral Therapy, which helps us work on our present and future. She also implements skills from ACT, Mindfulness, Gestalt, Humanistic, and Positive Psychology.
