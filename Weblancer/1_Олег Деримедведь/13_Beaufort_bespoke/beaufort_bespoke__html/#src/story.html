                            <p>
                                When Bryan realised how passionate Jonithan was about bespoke kitchens the two brothers
                                dreamed of having their own
                                company specialising in creating exceptional kitchens with an emphasis on design,
                                quality and customer service. Bryan
                                sold Beaufort Cottage, an old family home in Clevedon to fund the inception of the
                                business, which is where the name
                                comes from.

                                Outside of work Bryan has been involved with the Scouts, having run his own troop for
                                over a decade where he led
                                specialist pursuits including rock climbing, caving, water skiing and snowboarding. Now
                                in his 60’s Bryan is taking a
                                more leisurely approach to outdoor pursuits and can be found walking, canoeing or paddle
                                boarding. He has always had a
                                passion for cars and motorbikes and has travelled all over Europe as a result of this
                                endeavour.
