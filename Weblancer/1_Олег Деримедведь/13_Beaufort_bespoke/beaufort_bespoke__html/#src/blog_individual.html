                        So, you’ve decided to invest in a new kitchen this year -how exciting! To help you create the
                        kitchen of your dreams,
                        this short article outlines some of the key trends for 2021 - from appliance cupboards and wood
                        finishes to worktops. To
                        help your designer create a beautiful kitchen that will work for you, your family, and your
                        lifestyle, think about how
                        your new kitchen will fit into your daily routine and life. If you’re updating your kitchen,
                        what doesn’t work about it
                        now? By considering how your kitchen can work for you, it can truly become the heart of the home
                        you deserve.

                    <h2>
                        Natural Wood
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Natural wood cabinets bring a versatile warmth to your kitchen style. Wood is easy to maintain,
                        solid and hardwearing
                        and can be timeless or trendy to suit your chosen look. Cabinets manufactured from natural wood
                        are exceptionally solid
                        and have a long lifespan. Different woods have varied natural grains and patterns and can be
                        enhanced with your choice
                        of finish – from matte wax to a high gloss lacquer or a luxurious hand painted finish.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Birch continues to be a strong trend – the pale smooth grained wood is perfect for achieving a
                        calm Skandi look. Birch
                        is versatile and looks especially striking with black quartz worktops and brushed metal fittings
                        and appliances.
                        Consider pairing birch with grey based blues or greens for a tranquil start to the day.

                    <p>
                        Oak units are most often associated with a traditional kitchen. This golden-hued wood brings a
                        feeling of warmth,
                        permanence and craftsmanship that never dates. For a twist on tradition, oak units in a sleek
                        modern design look
                        particularly gorgeous! Try a zingy citrus hue on one wall to create an energising sociable
                        space.

                    <h3>
                        Mix and Match
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        The mix and match trend is a great way to make your kitchen unique to you. Mixing cabinet
                        styles, materials or colour
                        combinations easily achieves a personalised feel for your new kitchen space. Here are some ideas
                        to mix and match:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Wall cabinets and base cabinets in toning or contrasting colours – for a spacious feel in a
                            smaller kitchen, keep your
                            wall units pale coloured, or consider breaking up your wall cabinets with floating shelves
                            and lights.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Mix up finishes – natural wood base cabinets and contrast painted wall cabinets.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Worktop colours – using different worktop colours in your new kitchen can create visual
                            zones which can really lift a
                            design. Consider making a feature of your island unit or breakfast bar with a contrasting
                            colour work surface.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Mixed metals – choose small kitchen appliances, trims and cupboard handles in different
                            finishes for a quirky look.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>
                        Quartz Worktops
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        It’s easy to see why quartz kitchen worktops are so popular! Quartz worktops are made from
                        manufactured stone which is a
                        mix of around 93% stone, bonded with 7% resin and colourants. This gives a very hardwearing
                        worktop that really makes a
                        statement but is an extremely practical choice for your kitchen work surfaces. An extra benefit
                        is that a quartz worktop
                        does not need the care and regular resealing of granite and other natural stone choices, whilst
                        giving a luxurious feel
                        to your new kitchen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Quartz achieves the look of a granite worktop but is chip resistant and easy care. As it is a
                        manmade product, there is
                        a wide range of colour choices available, and it is easier to cut and lighter to fit than a
                        granite work top. Joins are
                        less prominent as quartz worktops can be templated and any joins worked into the design to
                        minimise their impact.

                        Breakfast Cupboards
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Whether you dream of organised work and school mornings, or a slow leisurely weekend breakfast,
                        then a breakfast
                        cupboard could just change your life! A close cousin of the pantry cupboard, a breakfast
                        cupboard is designed to hold
                        all your breakfast items, including appliances, all in one place. There are some fantastic space
                        saving (and clutter
                        concealing) cupboard designs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A breakfast cupboard can be designed for you and incorporate pull out shelves for a toaster,
                        integrated power sockets,
                        and room for your cups, bowls, and cereal packets too. Some designs have fold away or roller
                        doors for a neat space
                        saving idea – leaving counter space in front of the cupboard.

                    <p>
                        A breakfast cupboard frees up your work surfaces and conceals your appliances, whilst keeping
                        everything you need to
                        hand.
